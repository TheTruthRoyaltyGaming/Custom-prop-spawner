Truth's Prop Tester Script
This is a custom prop spawning script designed to easily test if your custom props are working correctly in GTA V. It's simple to use, so you should have no issues.

How to Install:
Drag and drop the truth_proptest folder into your server's resources directory.
Add start truth_proptest to your server.cfg.
Restart your server.
How to Use:
Once your server is restarted, your props will be automatically synced. You can then spawn any prop by typing:

bash
Copy code
/prop [propname]
Example: /prop truth_twix_prop

Troubleshooting:
If a prop doesn't spawn, double-check that you're using the correct prop name from your .ytyp file.
Ensure your fxmanifest.lua is set up properly for each prop.
The script is drag-and-drop ready, but if you encounter any errors, please thoroughly verify your setup before reaching out for assistance.
